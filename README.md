# D-DSoftware
- i have no promises that this entire project will be complete within the time frame given for the task - however this is a project i intend to continue outside of class for personal use in my group
- i plan to have completed the 10 main races and at least the basic functions needed in a D&D game - possibly missing some of the more complex features until i work on it personally
- save module may not work on initial project preview either
- things not included in inital preview that will be added in final :
    - fully working subraces
    - login module(there may POSSIBLY be a hard-coded login, but as of right now there is none)
    - saving feature
    - additional backgrounds and races - the races are coded into the combobox but do not work
    - conditions - might not appear even later, but i want to add them
    - simple spellbook, possibly more complex in late future.
    - feats, personalities, bonds, ect ect. i plan to add those to another menu in the future.
    - space to put other basic character info, just for roleplay purposes
    - a guide/help tool for new players
    - character creation leading questions to help new players
